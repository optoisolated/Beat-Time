# Beat Time
BeatTime is a concept created in the late 90's by Swiss watchmaker Swatch in order to allow for centralised time
that would be truly universal. The time of the day is represented by a 1000-beat day and is represented with an
@ symbol, then the beat time. 

[Wiki Source] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swatch_Internet_Time)

The neat feature of Beat time is that it shows the time as @0 or @300 or @945 everywhere in the world at the same time.

Reading beat time can take some getting used to and it wasn't very successful as an idea. The idea was still rather neat, so
I created a windows client for showing you the current Beat time and shows it in a way that helps you learn how to read it.

Decimal time is the future!

## Acknowledgments

* I originally wrote a version of this back in 1999 in VB4 and I came across the original code a few years ago. I rewrote it
in Visual Studio.net in order to make it compatible for Windows 10 and more flexible to use.
* It still needs a lot of tidying and it needs to be modularised.
* It could also benefit from a new skin.
